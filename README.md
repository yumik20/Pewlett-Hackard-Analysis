# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
database related project 


### Overview of the analysis:

In this company, there is a “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. I was given two assignments as following: 
 
1. determine the number of retiring employees per title, 
2. identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 


## Results:

# 1. determine the number of retiring employees per title results as below: 
count	title
29414	Senior Engineer
28254	Senior Staff
14222	Engineer
12243	Staff
4502	Technique Leader
1761	Assistant Engineer
2	Manager

# 2. Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
There are 1549 employees are qualified as mentor.  

## Summary:

In this project, I was able to create queries in Employee_Database_challenge.sql to create three new csv files named as retirement_titles.csv, unique_titles.csv, retiring_titles.csv, and mentorship_eligibilty.csv. 

There are 133776 employees in retirement_titles.cvs, 90398 employees in unique_titles.csv. Because there are many employees with different job titles as their titles changed over time, the actual number of employees with retirement eligibility is 90398. 

There are 1549 employees are qualified as mentor, and the top 1 title is Senior Staff, 426 employees have this title; then followed by Engineer and other 4 different titles. From leadership point of view, only the 426 Senior Staff, 291 Senior Engineer and 77 Technique Leader are suitable for mentoring ambitious younger employees. 

There are 7 different titles in retiring_titles.csv, the top 1 retiring title is Senior Engineer, followed by Senior Staff; the least is Manager title, only 2 people with this title.
